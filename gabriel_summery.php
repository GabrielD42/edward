			<p>I am a 14 year-old boy living in Santa Cruz, California. I have loved electronics and programming for several years and have aspired to build robots for a long time. I went to the Santa Cruz Waldorf School. My first robot was technically a project for school, although I was really just looking for an excuse to start building a robot.</p>
