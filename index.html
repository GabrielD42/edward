      <p><span id="leading">EDWARD (Electronically Driven Wireless Autonomous Roving Droid) is a robot I began building in 8th grade.</span> He navigates through a maze by mapping out its environment in its mind and using the Pythagorean Theorem to choose the best route. Here are the different components that make up EDWARD:</p>
      <h1>Electronics</h1>
      <div class="object-wrapper">
        <div class="object">
          <img alt="The Arduino Uno" src="arduino.jpg"/>
          <h3 class="delta">Arduino Uno</h3>
          <p>The brain of EDWARD. Contains the main program and controls everything from driving motors to communicating with the computer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="object">
          <img  alt="The Ultrasonic Ping))) Sensor" src="ping.png"/>
          <h3 class="delta">Ultrasonic Ping))) Sensor</h3>
          <p>EDWARD uses this to map his world and store it in his memory.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="object">
          <img alt="Servo Motor" src="head.jpg"/>
          <h3 class="delta">HS55 Servo Motor</h3>
          <p>Moves the ping sensor left and right so that all sides of every square of the maze can be scanned.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="object">
          <img alt="Continous Rotation Servo Motor" src="motor.png"/>
          <h3 class="delta">Continous Rotation Servo</h3>
          <p>Drives the wheels to turn EDWARD, who has a ball-bearing as a third point of contact.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="object">
          <img alt="XBEE Sensor" src="xbee.png"/>
          <h3 class="delta">XBEE Wireless Module</h3>
          <p>Provides communication with the computer so it can display what the robot knows for debugging purposes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="object">
          <img alt="Erector Wheel" src="wheel.jpg"/>
          <h3 class="delta">Erector Wheels</h3>
          <p>Rubber treads provide ample friction for EDWARD. Difficult to mount, however, due to their three screw holes and the motor horn's four.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="object">
          <img alt="Arduino XBEE Shield" src="xbeeshield.jpg"/>
          <h3 class="delta">Arduino XBEE Shield</h3>
          <p>An easy way to connect the XBEE to the Arduino. The only issue is that since the XBEE uses the same Serial port as the USB plug does, the radio module must be unplugged to upload code.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h1>Logic</h1>
      <p>In order to sucessfully navigate his world, EDWARD must make a large number of decisions. View this <a href="flow.png" target="_blank">flowchart</a> to see his process.</p>
      <h1>Software</h1>
      <p>These are some of the major components that make up the code on the Arduino. View the code on <a href="https://github.com/GabrielD42/edward" target="_blank">Github</a></p>
      <div class="object-wrapper">
    	  <div class="object">
    		  <h3 class="delta">Class Robot</h3>
            <p>Wrapper class, containing classes that manipulate the physical parts of the robot as well as class Map to remember everything the robot has learned. Also stores states only relevant to the robot such as x/y coordinates and its destinations. Most member classes are private as class Robot contains access methods so the integruity of the internal state variables is maintained.</p>
    	  </div>
        <div class="object">
          <h3 class="delta">Class Locomotion</h3>
          <p>Manages two Servo objects to coordinate the movement of the robot.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="object">
          <h3 class="delta">Class Map</h3>
          <p>A glorified array access Stores information about the maze. It consists of a grid of Squares. Provides access regulation and insures state integruity</p>
        </div>
        <div class="object">
          <h3 class="delta">Class Ping Sensor</h3>
          <p>Just a wrapper for a function to determine the distance from the sensor to the closest object.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="object">
          <h3 class="delta">Class Motorized Sensor</h3>
          <p>Includes a Servo object and a Ping Sensor object, ensuring that the head is only moved in conjunction with taking readings, and vice versa.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="object">
          <h3 class="delta">Class Square</h3>
          <p>Keeps track of where walls are; if the sides have been mapped yet; if an opening has been passed through by the robot; if an opening leads to a dead-end; and where the square was first entered.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="object">
          <h3 class="delta">Enumerations</h3>
          <p>The program uses two different enumerations. One to represent absolute (compass) directions and the other to represent relative (front, right, back, left) directions. Before I added these their were many issues when I accidentily converted between the two. Instead I now have a suite of functions to do that correctly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="object">
          <h3 class="delta">Function WhichWay</h3>
          <p>This is the most important function in the entire program. It measures the distance to the goal from every adjecent square of the robot using the Pythagorean Theorem. It then compares these distances and returns the direction that will lead to the shortest distance that is also not known to lead to a dead end and is not a wall. If no side is valid, then the robot is trapped. If the only valid way is to go back the way it came, then the loop() function will set the backtracking variable of the Robot object to true.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h1>Computer Display</h1>
      <p>The computer runs a processing script that picks up information from the serial port. After scanning walls, EDWARD sends information over XBEE to the computer with information on where the robot currently is and what is around it. The processing sketch stores that information and displays in in a color-coded grid, to assist debugging.</p>
