			<p>Originally, I was going to add many things to <a href="edward_summery.php">EDWARD</a> and continue improving it to a high degree. However, the motors I used were unreliable, and the wiring often short circited. Therefore, I am continuing the coding project in <a href = "ben_summery.php">BEN</a>, who I hope will be better suited to the job.</p>
